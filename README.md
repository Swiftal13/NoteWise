App to type up notes. On a tab
You can open new tabs to write on.
When you close it and open it again, the tabs are all still there. You can interchange between each tab.
Scroll through tabs. Anymore is saved in a folder.
The app strucures tabs in order of date modified


Next thing is to then integarte natural language processing
It can predict and autofill your sentences., and apuncutauation.
It only predicts if the text was typed. If there is a part which AI genereated, it does not predict any further till the person writes again ontop of it.

add widgets to create as new objects for each new note
Colour scheme modern pallete. **Might change to vibrant blue**
add highlighting mechanism


update, i switched to customtkinter module
i noticed to use the master root for the tkinter frame, i must assign the parent class of the tab object as self.frame so it exists for the object
I want to create the tabs functionality,and deletion. Then we focus on NLP processing and generation

errror with inheritance and nested loops. fixed
going to follow apple cualtor color scheme
